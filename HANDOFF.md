# Handoff

The shared log between chat (Claude on claude.ai) and Claude Code. Newest entry first in each section.

Rules:
1. Chat writes only under "Specs". Claude Code writes only under "Log".
2. A spec is marked done by adding one line under it, "Done: <date of the log entry>". Nothing else is edited.
3. A log entry is not complete without the commit hash and the numbers the checks printed.
4. If this file and chat disagree, this file wins.

## Specs (from chat)

### 2026-10-07 Record a baseline
Change: no code change. Run the full test suite and the quick ladder once, and log the results.
Why: everything later is compared against this.
Checks that must pass: `run_tests` reports 0 failures. `ladder.run('all', numerics='quick')` finishes; log the `model.checks` values (`c_bound_25_39`, `ce_entry`) for steps 6 to 9, both tenures.

## Log (from Claude Code)

### 2026-10-07 Starting state (checked from chat, not a Claude Code run)
Repo: main at 9fa84ac, equal to github/main. Untracked: `demo - Copy/`, `demo - Copy.zip`.
The ladder, `run_tests` and `model.checks` are in main. The old `param_fingerprint` gate is gone; `ladder.same_calibration` replaces it.
Checks run: none.
Open: baseline spec above.

## Entry formats

Spec:

    ### <date> <short title>
    Change: what to change.
    Why: one line.
    Checks that must pass: what to run and what result counts.

Log:

    ### <date> <short title> (spec: <title or none>)
    Changed: files and what.
    Checks run: command, then the numbers it printed.
    Commit: <hash>, pushed to main.
    Open: what is left, or "none".
